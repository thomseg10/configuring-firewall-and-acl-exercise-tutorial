# `03` Validate your work

This step consists of running a verification script to validate what is required in this practice. Follow these steps:

## 1. Run the script

On the desktop of your Debian machine, download this file [check-ip-tables.sh](https://github.com/breatheco-de/iptables-blocking-practice/blob/master/.learn/assets/check-ip-tables.sh).

Navigate to the directory where the check-ip-tables.sh script is located. You can use the cd command to change directories. For example, if the script is in the Documents folder, you should run:

```sh
cd ~/Documents
```

Make the script executable (if it is not already). This can be done using the chmod command:

```sh
chmod +x check-ip-tables.sh
```

Run the script by specifying the script name. You can also provide any necessary arguments. Assuming no additional arguments are needed for this example, you should run:

```sh
./check-ip-tables.sh
```

## 2. Upload your results

Running the script will create a file named report.json that you must upload as the solution to this project.

## 3. Done!

You have now protected your WordPress server effectively through basic and advanced firewall settings.
